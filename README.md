The problem: "A coin with a 2-cm diameter is dropped onto a sheet of paper ruled by parallel lines that are 3 cm apart. Which is more likely, that the coin will land on a line, or that it will not?"

Baisc Info:
- Red circles are coins that touch a line
- Green circles are coins that do not touch a line
- The info in the top left displays numberGreen/totalCoins
- Basic settings for the game can be found at the top of 'game.js'
- Window size does not matter, it should work on almost any sized screen
- Because of the use of random, it might take some time before the number stablizes at the answer
